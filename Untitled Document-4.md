The mashup I chose titled "[*This is definetely not the 405*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mYyrD3o5AA)" by [Super Mash Bros](https://soundcloud.com/super-mash-bros), is a remix that feautres clips and beats from 11 different songs. The reason why  Super Mash Bros were allowed to produce this remix and are allowed to keep producing more remixes along with many other artists is because their work is protected under **fair use** of copyrighted material.

#### Fair Use for Super Mash Bros:

1. The number one reason I believe this mash up is fair use is because the samples of the songs are so short and changed so dramatically that they do not resemble the original songs. According to [title 17 ยง 107 in the US code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107). The use of copyrighted material is considered fair use if the portion of the used work is not significant when being compared to the entire original work. In the remix I chose, the portions taken from songs are very small. Most of them only last a couple of seconds with the original songs being 3 or more minutes. Another part of title 17 states that if the use of the copyrighted matierial does not directly effect the use of the original work then it is fair use. For instance, this remix is not goign to take away profit from the 11 other artists that are featured in this remix. The remix is not a subsitiute for any of the albums featuring the songs that are in it.
2. Secondly, the purpose of this remix is not to steal fans or attention away from the other artists. Nor is it to create a profit for the artist who created the remix. Super Mash Bros put their music on a free sharing website called soundcloud. While they do get "hits" when people listen to their creations they do not get paid. Since the purpose of their remixes are for enjoyment, and not to create a profit it is considered fair use.
3. The nature of the remix is a song like the original songs that were used but it is not a song that is supposed to replicate the copyrighted songs. For example, if the remix pulled form another song and didnt really change the way it sounded or the structure at all this would not be considered fair use. Because the remix sounds nothing like any other songs it is unique enough to be considered one of a kind.
4. Lastly, this song is not really going to have a major effect on the market that the other artists are in. Although this song may have become popular it would not take away from the popularity of the songs included in the remix because it is in a whole different genre of music. I also argue to say that they are two totally different markets altogether making it impossible for this remix to have an effect on the other songs.
